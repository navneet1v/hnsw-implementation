/**
 * Off-heap storage for vector data using direct ByteBuffer for memory efficiency.
 * 
 * <p>This class provides efficient storage for large numbers of high-dimensional vectors
 * by allocating memory outside the Java heap. Benefits include:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Reduced garbage collection pressure</li>
 *   <li>Better memory locality for vector operations</li>
 *   <li>Predictable memory usage for large datasets</li>
 *   <li>Faster I/O operations when interfacing with native code</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>The storage is pre-allocated for a fixed number of vectors with fixed dimensions.
 * Vectors are stored sequentially in a contiguous memory block for cache-efficient access.
 * 
 * <h3>Memory Layout:</h3>
 * <pre>
 * [vector0_dim0, vector0_dim1, ..., vector0_dimN,
 *  vector1_dim0, vector1_dim1, ..., vector1_dimN,
 *  ...]
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <h3>Usage Example:</h3>
 * <pre>{@code
 * OffHeapVectorsStorage storage = new OffHeapVectorsStorage(128, 1000000);
 * 
 * // Add vectors
 * float[] vector = new float[128];
 * storage.addVector(vector);
 * 
 * // Retrieve vectors
 * float[] retrieved = storage.getVector(0);
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * <p><b>Note:</b> This class does not automatically free off-heap memory. The memory
 * will be released when the ByteBuffer is garbage collected, but explicit cleanup
 * may be needed for long-running applications.
